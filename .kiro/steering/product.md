# NEXUS - Product Overview

NEXUS is a knowledge base template that supports three navigation modes:

1. **Horizontal** - Stacking panes (Andy Matuschak-style) for exploring connections while preserving context
2. **Linear** - Sequential prev/next navigation for documentation
3. **Graphical** - Interactive node graph showing relationships

## Key Features

- Obsidian-style `[[wikilinks]]` with automatic backlink detection
- In-browser note editing with real-time saves
- AI-powered search (optional, requires OpenAI key)
- MCP server endpoint for AI agent integration
- Two modes: "personal" (flat exploration) and "documentation" (structured TOC)

## Target Users

- Personal knowledge management (wikis, notes)
- Company documentation with AI-native querying
- Any linked content that benefits from multi-pane exploration

## Configuration

All site customization is done via `nexus.config.yaml` at project root - themes, layout, features, auth, and navigation structure.
